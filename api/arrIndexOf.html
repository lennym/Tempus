    <p>
        While many browsers, include <code>Array.prototype.indexOf</code>, 
        namely Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7 &amp; 8 do not. Because of this, 
        we cannot depend on its existence, and it is therefore easier to use a 
        custom helper function.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is worth noting that <code>arrIndexOf</code> is not a to-spec 
        replacement of <code>Array.prototype.indexOf</code>. It is not as strict, 
        does not include the fromIndex argument, and it does not coerce the 
        <code>length</code> attribute into a number. If you require a to spec
        implimentation of <code>Array.prototype.indexOf</code>, do not use this.
